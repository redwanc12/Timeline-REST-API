# recipe-app-api
First Python Django and Rest Framework project.  

I created an example of an API to send and recieve data (of Recipes as an example) to a database.

# Technologies
Database: Postgresql (image packaged using Docker)
Django Rest Framework
Requests

Will eventually be used as an API used with my iPhone apps (Swift).
